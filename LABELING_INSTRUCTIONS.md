# Manual Tweet Labeling Instructions

## Purpose
Label tweets with sentiment scores to validate our automated sentiment analysis model (twitter-roberta + finance keywords).

---

## How to Label

### 1. **manual_sentiment_score** (Required)
Rate the tweet's sentiment on a scale from **-1.0 to +1.0**:

- **-1.0 to -0.5**: **Strongly Bearish** 
  - Example: "Market crash incoming", "Nifty breakdown", "sell everything"
  
- **-0.5 to -0.1**: **Mildly Bearish**
  - Example: "Resistance ahead", "caution advised", "profit booking expected"
  
- **-0.1 to +0.1**: **Neutral**
  - Example: News updates, factual statements, promotional content without bias
  
- **+0.1 to +0.5**: **Mildly Bullish**
  - Example: "Good support level", "potential upside", "watch this stock"
  
- **+0.5 to +1.0**: **Strongly Bullish**
  - Example: "Breakout confirmed!", "Strong rally", "Buy the dip", "massive profit"

### 2. **manual_sentiment_label** (Required)
Choose one:
- `BEARISH` (score < -0.1)
- `NEUTRAL` (score between -0.1 and +0.1)
- `BULLISH` (score > +0.1)

### 3. **confidence** (Required)
How confident are you in your label?
- `HIGH`: Clear sentiment, easy to interpret
- `MEDIUM`: Some ambiguity but leaning one way
- `LOW`: Very unclear, promotional spam, or contradictory signals

### 4. **notes** (Optional)
Add any comments:
- Why you chose this sentiment
- Specific keywords that influenced your decision
- Any ambiguity or special considerations

## Special Cases

### **Promotional/Spam Tweets**
(e.g., "Join my Telegram", "Get free tips")
- **Score:** 0.0 (neutral)
- **Label:** NEUTRAL
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Notes:** "Promotional content - no market sentiment"

### **Factual News**
(e.g., "NSE revises lot sizes", "Bank reported 17% increase")
- **Score:** 0.0 to +0.2 (slightly positive if it's good news)
- **Label:** NEUTRAL or BULLISH (depending on news)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM to HIGH

### **Profit Updates**
(e.g., "Profit of Rs 63k")
- **Score:** +0.3 to +0.7 (bullish - successful trades inspire confidence)
- **Label:** BULLISH
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM to HIGH

### **Multiple Sentiments in One Tweet**
(e.g., "HAL hit target, but TATA hit stop-loss")
- Score based on **overall net sentiment**

## Tips for Consistency

1. **Focus on market sentiment**, not personal opinion
2. **Consider the author's intent** - are they bullish, bearish, or just sharing info?
3. **Keywords matter:**
   - Bullish: profit, breakout, rally, support, buy, calls, target hit
   - Bearish: loss, breakdown, resistance, sell, puts, stop-loss hit
4. **Ignore promotional noise** - focus on the actual market signal
5. **When in doubt**, go with NEUTRAL and MEDIUM/LOW confidence
