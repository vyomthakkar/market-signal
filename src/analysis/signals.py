Text-to-Signal Conversion Module

Transforms tweet content into numerical vectors for quantitative analysis.

Planned Approaches:
- TF-IDF vectorization (bag-of-words with importance weighting)
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, or sentence transformers)
- Custom feature engineering (domain-specific signals)

Output: Numerical vectors suitable for machine learning and trading algorithms

TODO: Implementation to be discussed and designed
