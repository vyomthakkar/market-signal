Signal Aggregation Module

Combines multiple text features into composite trading signals with confidence intervals.

Planned Features:
- Multi-signal combination (weighted averaging, voting, ensemble methods)
- Confidence interval calculation
- Time-weighted aggregation (recent tweets weighted more)
- Signal normalization and scaling
- Trading signal generation (-1: bearish, 0: neutral, +1: bullish)

TODO: Implementation to be discussed and designed
