"""
Memory-Efficient Visualization Module

Creates low-memory plotting solutions for large datasets.

Planned Techniques:
- Streaming plots (process data in chunks)
- Data sampling (representative subsets for visualization)
- Aggregated time-series plots
- Interactive dashboards (Plotly)
- Large dataset optimization (Datashader for millions of points)

Visualization Types:
- Signal timeline plots
- Sentiment distribution
- Engagement vs. sentiment scatter
- Confidence intervals over time
- Trading signal strength heatmaps

TODO: Implementation to be discussed and designed
