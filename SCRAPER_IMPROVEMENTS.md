# Twitter/X Scraper Improvements

## Problem Solved
The scraper was getting stuck when a hashtag had fewer tweets than the target `tweets_per_tag`. For example, if `#sensex` only had 39 tweets but the target was 50, the scraper would keep scrolling indefinitely trying to find more tweets.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Smart Exit Detection**
The scraper now exits gracefully when:
- **No new tweets found**: Stops after 3 consecutive scrolls with no new unique tweets
- **Page height unchanged**: Stops after 5 consecutive scrolls where the page doesn't grow
- **Target reached**: Stops immediately when the target number of tweets is collected

### 2. **Detailed Logging**
Enhanced logging shows:
```
Collected 45 tweets for #sensex (+5 new)
No new tweets found (attempt 1/3)
No new tweets found (attempt 2/3)
No new tweets found after 3 attempts. Ending search for #sensex
```

### 3. **Collection Statistics**
The scraper now provides a comprehensive summary:

```
============================================================
COLLECTION SUMMARY
============================================================
✓ #nifty50: 50/50 tweets (100.0%)
⚠ #sensex: 39/50 tweets (78.0%)
✓ #intraday: 50/50 tweets (100.0%)
✓ #banknifty: 50/50 tweets (100.0%)

Total tweets collected: 189
Unique tweets after deduplication: 185
Duplicates removed: 4
============================================================
```

Statistics are also saved to `collection_stats.json`:
```json
{
  "nifty50": {
    "collected": 50,
    "target": 50,
    "percentage": 100.0
  },
  "sensex": {
    "collected": 39,
    "target": 50,
    "percentage": 78.0
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Quick Test (50 tweets per hashtag)
```bash
python3 playwright_scrapper.py
```
This will take ~5-10 minutes

### Production Run (500 tweets per hashtag)
Update line 397 in `playwright_scrapper.py`:
```python
result = await scraper.scrape_multiple_hashtags(hashtags, tweets_per_tag=500)
```
This will take ~30-60 minutes

## Output Files

1. **raw_tweets.json** - All collected tweets with full metadata
2. **collection_stats.json** - Statistics showing success rate per hashtag

## Key Parameters (Can be tuned in `search_hashtag` method)

```python
max_scroll_attempts = 5        # Max scrolls with unchanged height
max_no_new_tweets = 3          # Max scrolls without finding new tweets
```

These can be adjusted based on:
- Network speed (increase if slow connection)
- Tweet frequency (increase for very active hashtags)
- Time constraints (decrease for faster but less thorough scraping)

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Never gets stuck** - Always exits gracefully
2. ✅ **Maximizes collection** - Gets all available tweets before stopping
3. ✅ **Clear visibility** - Know exactly what was collected
4. ✅ **Handles edge cases** - Works with hashtags of any size
5. ✅ **Efficient** - Doesn't waste time on empty scrolls
