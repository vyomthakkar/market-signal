# Target Hashtags Feature Update

## Summary

Modified the analysis script to ensure the overall market sentiment uses **ALL tweets** in the dataset, while providing detailed analysis for specific target hashtags.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Data Filtering (run/2_analyze_signals.py)

**Before:**
- When `--hashtags` flag was used, the script filtered the entire dataset to only tweets containing those hashtags
- This reduced the dataset (e.g., 2030 â†’ 1863 tweets)
- Overall market signal was calculated from filtered subset

**After:**
- ALL tweets are always loaded and analyzed
- No filtering occurs at the data loading stage
- Overall market signal uses the complete dataset

### 2. Updated Behavior

#### Overall Market Sentiment
- Uses **ALL tweets** from the dataset
- Aggregates signals from **ALL hashtags**
- Provides comprehensive market view

#### Target Hashtag Analysis
- When `--hashtags` is specified, detailed summaries are shown for those specific hashtags
- Does NOT filter the overall market analysis
- Useful for monitoring specific coins/instruments while maintaining market context

### 3. Updated CLI Arguments

**--hashtags**: Target hashtags for detailed analysis (default: nifty, nifty50, sensex, banknifty, intraday)
**--all-hashtags**: Skip detailed hashtag summary (analyze all hashtags equally)

## Example Usage

```bash
# Analyze all tweets, show details for specific hashtags
python run/2_analyze_signals.py --hashtags nifty sensex banknifty

# Analyze all tweets, no specific hashtag focus
python run/2_analyze_signals.py --all-hashtags
```

## Output Behavior

### With --hashtags nifty sensex
```
ðŸŽ¯ TARGET MODE: Overall market uses ALL tweets, detailed analysis for: #nifty, #sensex

Loaded 2030 tweets  # All tweets loaded

Overall market signal: Uses all 2030 tweets
Target hashtag summary: Shows detailed breakdown only for #nifty and #sensex
```

### With --all-hashtags
```
ðŸ“Š FULL MODE: Analyzing all hashtags in dataset

Loaded 2030 tweets  # All tweets loaded

Overall market signal: Uses all 2030 tweets
No specific hashtag focus - all hashtags treated equally
```

## Benefits

1. **More Accurate Market View**: Overall sentiment reflects the entire market, not just filtered coins
2. **Focused Analysis**: Still get detailed insights for specific hashtags of interest
3. **Better Context**: Can see how target hashtags perform relative to the overall market
4. **No Data Loss**: All collected data is utilized in the analysis
